Title - Oxygen Generator Light Weight Bag.

Description - The main problem faced by Covid patients is that it becomes hard for them to move and travel with the heavy oxygen cylinder. Our idea is to create a light weight bag pack that can generate oxygen from the surrounding air and it will be easy to carry and easily movable.
The bag pack will have the required components which will be generating oxygen continuously from the air. And it will be just like a school bag easy to carry and light weight. In case of emergency, the person can reach out the nearest hospital easily while using this bag on his own so, no need for others to carry the heavy oxygen cylinder.



Hardware requirements :-
1- Zeolites for trapping Nitrogen from air.
2- Silica Gel for absorption of moisture and dust particles from the oxygenated air.
3- PVC pipes to make containers .
4- Mini 12v air compressor.
5- Battery 12v rechargeable and small in size.
6- Medical air pipes.
7- medical oxygen mask.
8- 3d printed bag pack properly fitted inside the polyester bag.
